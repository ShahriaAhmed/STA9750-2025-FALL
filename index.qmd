Hello, my name is Shahria but most people call me Shah. Welcome to my site! Here's a little bit about me.\

I'm a data scientist on Wall Street, working on AI development and testing in equity research. Currently I'm getting my Master's at CUNY Baruch. But in between work and school, I take a lot of pictures. Sunsets, cityscapes, portraits, nature, astrophotography â€” I love it all! My interest started back in school when I worked on an in-depth research report on Alzheimer's. It's a brutal and unforgiving disease with no cure. I wanted to remember all the things I've experienced when I became old, so I started taking pictures with my iPhone 6 at the time.

My current setup:

* Fujifilm X100V for travel photography, compactness and film recipes
* Sony A7RIII + Zeiss 85mm lens for portraits and everything else \


Thanks for visiting!
